# eduton
The project is made for Hack the Fall season 2, the project aims to provide free education to all form all

**Eduton** is a website built with the inspiration of improving Diversity & Inclusion. Is Education in the world today  provided equally to everyone?does the people with low income or the people who face racial/societal problems get equal quality of education? We all know that education is the foremost important thing for making this world a better place.We have a solution for this.That is Eduton

## What it does
Eduton is a website where anyone can teach anyone.We don't insist you to have a particular qualification to be a tutor.You can teach anyone around the world if you are well versed about that particular topic.The quality of content will be verified by our team of experts.People can get free live sessions, 1-1 training and much more quality educational content from any part of the world.We also collaborate with many *NGOs* around the world to support digital education in rural areas and the the unprivileged people.We have many under rated talents in the world.We just have to take one step to make that talent shine better.

## How we built it
We built this website with HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, LINODE AND BOOTSTRAP. Many more feature will be added soon.

## Challenges we ran into
We explored tons of ideas and confused of what can we do something new.We also tried to include the chat option and video calling option with dolby.io . As for the time concern we only could able represent the demo website.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Eduton is proud of connecting NGOs all around the world to support digital learning with the nearby tutors.We are proud of making the quality education available for everyone irrespective all the diversities we have.Now a days we can see many websites costing so high for a single course.But Eduton makes a difference by making it free of cost.

## What we learned
We learnt how to work together to create great things.We also learned a lot by working with all the resources that you provided in Hack the fall 2021. It's a great experience of having more innovative way of coding

## What's next for Eduton
-Eduton is next up to connect with all the NGOs and conduct classes at the **rural areas**.
-We also have a plan of updating the website with more interesting features like live chat,calls etc,..
-We also have an idea of providing **stipend** to all the tutors in future.
